          <p className="text-yellow-100/80 leading-relaxed">
            Your breath is the bridge between consciousness and the physical world. It's the native language of the universe. By breathing unconsciously, you reinforce your current reality. By breathing with focused intention, you issue new commands to the fabric of existence. Each pattern in this app attunes your energy to a specific frequency, allowing you to dissolve limitations, attract desires, and align with the cosmic flow of creation. This isn't just relaxation; it's the art of reality-sculpting.
